Q1: So you're finishing up your time in this CSCC program. Why did you decide to embark on this journey?

    I decided to embark into this journey for two reasons. One, to get into development, currently work within I&O. Two, wanted to learn more about Java with hopes of being a Java Developer one day.

Q2: I love to travel. Tell me a bit about your favorite travel destination so far. What's on your travel bucket list?

    Not really big on traveling, 11 years ago I was a professional Truck Driver, gained 3 million miles under my belt, basically have been coast-to-coast. So, the act of traveling is not a desire.

Q3: Name your favorite member of The Beatles, and your favorite Beatles song. You do know at least one Beatles song, right? If you are a Beatles fan, feel free to give me your top 5 or so.

    I'm not familiar with any Beatles classics, sorry. Not my type of music.

Q4: Do you have any pets? Species/Name/Details please. Murray wants to know... (he's not as smart as that picture makes him seem).

    Don't care too much for pets, I'm allergic to dog dander and don't like pets.
